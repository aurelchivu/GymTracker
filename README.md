GymTracker is build using MERN stack and is an app that tracks your progress in the gym, gives you a workout routine depending on the last sessions you had for each muscle group, and gives you a meal plan depending on the results we want to have. It's synchronized with Google Calendar, uses Spotify API to listen to music while training, uses Youtube API to search for training exercises, finds a gym near you when you are in a different place, has a built-in timer to track your time spent in the gym.
